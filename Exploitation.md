### Steps to reproduce

1. Create an account on the target website and log in to the application.
   - Take note of the JWT token stored in localStorage.
   - Find an admin users account name in the application.

2. Find the exposed .env file in the application.
   - The .env file contains the JWT_SECRET used to sign the tokens.

3. Use the JWT_SECRET to forge a valid JWT token for the admin user.
   - Use jwt.io to decode the JWT token and verify its signature using the JWT_SECRET.

    *Example payload:*

    ```json
    {
    "username": "bob",
    "role": "admin",
    "iat": 1746549031
    }
    ```

   - The `iat` (issued at) claim can be set to any valid timestamp, as long as the token is not expired when you use it.

   - The `role` claim can be set to "admin" to gain admin privileges.

   - Then we can sign the token with the JWT_SECRET from the .env file.

4. Swap the forged JWT token with the one in localStorage.
   - Open the developer console in your browser and navigate to the "Application" tab.
   - Find the "Local Storage" section and replace the existing JWT token with your forged token.
   - Then refresh the page.
   - You should now have access to the admin interface and be able to view sensitive information.
